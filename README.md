# Welcome to hangman in C/Terminal

While there are still some imperfections, the game should work without any bugs.

## Linux
Required files:
* `dictionary`
* `hangman.c`
* `Makefile`

just type `make`, then `make run` to launch.

## Windows
Required files:
* `dictionary`
* `hangman.exe`
  
just launch the `hangman.exe` to play a session of hangman.

## Notes:
- add difficulty selector - reduces the number of mistakes one can make
- return to main menu instead of terminating the program
- increase maximum word size?
- there is probably more stuff to be done
